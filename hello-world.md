Hey there! I'm Hunter Henrichsen, a Utah-based Computer Science student. Turns 
out, I like to write as well, so I'm starting this blog to do some of that.

I started programming when I was fourteen. I started with Java, as Minecraft
was, and still is to a degree, my passion, and that was the language that you
could write cool things like plugins and mods in. In watching some tutorials by
[TheNewBoston](https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston), I encountered some
thing that I just couldn't understand: Arrays. Why we would need lists of data
in programming baffled me, so I decided to go back to whatever else I was doing
and gave up for awhile.

When I was sixteen, I was getting ready to take a programming class the next
semester, and I decided I'd learn some of the basics again. This time I found
another person who was focused on individuals who already had some idea what
they were doing in Java. I liked their format more, and followed all the way
through this time. I was hooked. I was able to creat things all of my own,
without needing to spend anything.

That programming class took the form of more teaching for me rather than
learning, as I spent time helping my peers and blazing through the lectures. It
was here that I learned that I like to learn by teaching others, and that's
helped me through the rest of my life since that point. 

Post-High School, I decided that I'd go to university for a degree in Computer
Science. I'm now a Junior. I've worked on some cool projects through my
cirriculum, with clubs, and on my own. With a friend I worked on a game for a
little while. With the Humans vs Zombies club, I built a tag tracking website
for their games with some neat features they didn't otherwise have. I've built a
few website systems and such on my own. And I work as a freelance full-stack
developer. 

And... that's it for now.

If you want to check out my projects, I have a few available on [my GitHub
account](https://github.com/hhenrichsen).
